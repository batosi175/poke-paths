## Intro

In Poke Paths we want to help pokemon find their way home. You can do so by using this app to select a starting location, an ending location and all obstacles that stand between them and safety. We will be reaching out to Citrine Informatics to help us calculate a safe path.

## Notes

I made this application using `create-react-app` and typescript `--template typescript`.

It may take a minute to see results on a cold start since the `find-path` endpoint is hosted on Heroku and I did not add a loading state.

I used Material-ui because it's a solution that comes with a lot of good styling out of the box

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the required dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Additional libraries

[Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/): Is a ui library with several components and styling options
